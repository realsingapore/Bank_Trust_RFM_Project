- This phase displays the dataset’s shape to show how many rows and columns it has, identifies the data types of each column, checks for missing values to highlight potential data quality issues, and provides basic statistical summaries to reveal patterns, ranges, and possible outliers. The goal is to give a concise overview of the dataset’s structure and quality before deeper analysis.
